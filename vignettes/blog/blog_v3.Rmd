title: "mcmcensemble 3.0.0: new way of specifying inits values"
output: html_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In previous mcmcensemble versions, the starting values of the various were
drawn from an uniform distribution whose bounds were determined by the values
of `lower.inits` and `upper.inits`.

In this new version, the user is in charge of providing a matrix (or a
data.frame) containing all the starting values for all the parameters for all 
the chains. If this increases somewhat the complexity of the package and the 
workload of the user, it has huge benefits that we will present now.

```{r}
library(mcmcensemble)
packageVersion("mcmcensemble")
```

## Sample from a non-uniform distribution

The main drawback from the previous behaviour is that it was not possible to 
sample the initial values from something else than a uniform distribution. You
can now do this. If we take the 'banana' example from the `README` and want to
start with values samples from a normal distribution centered on 0 with a 
standard deviation of 2, we do:

```{r}
## a log-pdf to sample from
p.log <- function(x) {
  B <- 0.03 # controls 'bananacity'
  -x[1]^2 / 200 - 1/2 * (x[2] + B * x[1]^2 - 100 * B)^2
}

## set options and starting point
n_walkers <- 10
unif_inits <- data.frame(
  "a" = rnorm(n_walkers, mean = 0, sd = 2),
  "b" = rnorm(n_walkers, mean = 0, sd = 1)
)

res <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = unif_inits,
                     max.iter = 5000, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                     method = "stretch", coda = TRUE)

summary(res$samples)
plot(res$samples)
```

It is also a good opportunity to set quasi-random starting values that maximises
to exploration of the available space. One example of a such quasi-random
distribution is the [Owen-scrambled Sobol sequence](https://www.spacefillr.com/reference/generate_sobol_owen_set.html)
available in the [spacefillr](https://www.spacefillr.com/) package.

```{r}
n_walkers <- 10
sobol_inits <- setNames(
  spacefillr::generate_sobol_owen_set(n_walkers, dim = 2),
  c("a", "b")
)
res <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = sobol_inits,
                     max.iter = 5000, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                     method = "stretch", coda = TRUE)

summary(res$samples)
plot(res$samples)
```

## Re-start a chain from where it ended

Another new possibility thanks to this new behaviour in mcmcensemble 3.0.0 is
the option to restart a chain from where it ended. Let's use again the
'banana' example from the `README` but let's cut it short:

```{r}
## a log-pdf to sample from
p.log <- function(x) {
  B <- 0.03 # controls 'bananacity'
  -x[1]^2 / 200 - 1/2 * (x[2] + B * x[1]^2 - 100 * B)^2
}

## set options and starting point
n_walkers <- 10
unif_inits <- data.frame(
  "a" = runif(n_walkers, 0, 1),
  "b" = runif(n_walkers, 0, 1)
)

## use stretch move
short <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = unif_inits,
                      max.iter = 50, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                      method = "stretch", coda = TRUE)

summary(short$samples)
plot(short$samples)
```

You may notice that this example has a very low number of iteration. We may want
to let it run a little bit more. We can restart the chain from where it ended 
with:

```{r}
last_values <- do.call(rbind, lapply(short$samples, function(c) c[nrow(c), ]))

longer <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = last_values,
                       max.iter = 4950, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                       method = "stretch", coda = TRUE)

# `final` is the concatenation of `short` and `longer`
# However, we need to remove the first element of `longer` since it's already
# present in `short`
final <- list(
  samples = coda::as.mcmc.list(lapply(seq_along(longer$samples), function(i) {
    coda::as.mcmc(rbind(short$samples[[i]], longer$samples[[i]][-1, ]))
  })),
  log.p = cbind(short$log.p, longer$log.p[, -1])
)

plot(final$samples)
```

For non-coda outputs, here is the equivalent coda snippet:

```{r}
short <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = unif_inits,
                      max.iter = 50, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                      method = "stretch")

last_values <- short$samples[, dim(short$samples)[2], ]

longer <- MCMCEnsemble(p.log, inits = last_values,
                       max.iter = 4950, n.walkers = n_walkers,
                       method = "stretch")

# `final` is the concatenation of `short` and `longer`
# However, we need to remove the first element of `longer` since it's already
# present in `short`
final <- list(
  samples = array(unlist(lapply(seq_len(dim(longer$samples)[3]), function(i) {
    cbind(longer$samples[,, i], short$samples[,, i])
  })), dim = dim(short$samples) + c(0, dim(longer$samples)[2], 0)),
  log.p = cbind(short$log.p, longer$log.p[, -1])
)
```

## Migrating from mcmcensemble 2.X to mcmcensemble 3.X

As mentioned in the introduction of this blog post, the prior distribution in
previous versions of mcmcensemble was always a uniform distribution between 
`lower.inits` and `upper.inits`. It means that your previous code snippets:

```{r v2-chunk, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
MCMCEnsemble(
  p.log, 
  lower.inits = c(-5, -15), upper.inits = c(5, 15),
  max.iter = 500, n.walkers = 10,
  method = "stretch", coda = TRUE
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair::flair_lines(flair::decorate_chunk("v2-chunk", eval = FALSE), 3)
```

must be updated to:

```{r v3-chunk, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
MCMCEnsemble(
  p.log, 
  inits = runif(10, min = c(-5, -15), max = c(5, 15)),
  max.iter = 500, n.walkers = 10,
  method = "stretch", coda = TRUE
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
flair::flair_lines(flair::decorate_chunk("v3-chunk", eval = FALSE), 3)
```
